## AES-GO

This is _not_ a library suitable for production, it not considered secure or performant. DO NOT USE IT. 

This is my learning project about AES and Padding Oracle attacks on AES CBC. 

The code is optmised for readability and learning. It tries to expand show AES and padding oracle step by step.

Some interesting resources to read:

- [AES in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
